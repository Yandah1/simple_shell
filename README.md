This is a repository for the C - Simple Shell team project.

Done by : Nonkululeko Khanyile and Nimrod Sekwati

The objective of this project is to create a simple UNIX shell. The shell should be able to handle basic commands such as ls, cd, pwd, echo, and exit. The shell should also be able to handle pipes and redirection.

The shell is written in C and is fully documented. All codes have to pass all of the Betty checks.
